         <p>IAS organizes juried online art shows on a monthly basis. Each exhibition is presented in one of our virtual 3D gallery spaces and features only the very best artworks submitted in response to our open-competition calls. Selected artists will gain recognition by being awarded a "Best of Show", or one of our three "Merit Award" certificates. These selected artists will also get additional exposure by being promoted on our Featured Artists page.</p>
